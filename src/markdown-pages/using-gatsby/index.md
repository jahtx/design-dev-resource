# Using Gatsby

Gatsby is an excellent blogging platform, but there is a learning curve.

When I first decided to remake my website, I thought of the usual suspects: plain HTML and maybe using automation with Gulp or Grunt, WordPress, or React. I saw many React developers swear by Gatsby (which is just a way to make a static site with React), and while it is friendly and addictive it does require more legwork than say WordPress or Wix. 

If you do decide to step forward with Gatsby, I do have a recommended path. 

* I would recommend the beginning steps from the [Gatsby website](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/) particularly for setting up your Development environment and creating your first site.
* Do set some time to understand [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) if you haven't already. Again, [Gatsby's website](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-4/) is an excellent resource to touch up on it. I would say a comprehensive understanding of GraphQL is not completely required to get started.
